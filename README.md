# Currency Predictor Web Interface

This version of the code incorporates a web interface using Yew to predict the price of a specific currency. However, we currently face challenges integrating it with the API fetching code. The asynchronous nature of the requests appears to be incompatible with our existing codebase.

## Usage

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Execute the command `trunk serve` in your terminal.

   ```bash
   trunk serve
   ```

This will launch the web interface, allowing you to interact with the currency predictor.
